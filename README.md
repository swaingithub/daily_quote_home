## AI Coding Approach

This project was developed with the assistance of **Antigravity**, an advanced AI coding agent by Google DeepMind.

**Methodology:**
- **Iterative Development**: The app was built through a series of prompted tasks, starting from project creation to specific feature implementations like robust theming (light/dark mode) and UI refinement.
- **Agentic Workflow**: The AI agent (Antigravity) autonomously managed file systems, executed terminal commands, and performed complex code edits to satisfy high-level user requirements.
- **Design-First**: Emphasis was placed on "rich aesthetics" and "visual excellence", utilizing custom themes, typography, and responsive layouts.
- **Problem Solving**: The AI actively debugged issues (e.g., layout overflows, theme data types) by analyzing error logs and applying targeted fixes.
- **Technology**: Built using Flutter/Dart, leveraging `provider` for state management and local storage for persistence.
